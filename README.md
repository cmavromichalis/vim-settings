# vim-settings
A minimal vimrc, set of plugins, with no external dependencies.

## Basics
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is used as the plugin manager
here. [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) is used to provide
very basic settings, the vimrc itself only really relates to settings managing
plugins, personal settings, etc.
